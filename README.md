# PaGpConnector

This is a POC designed to show off the flexibility of the Palo Alto API. It demonstrates how you would get a list of devices a GlobalProtect user should have access to from a third party and then create Security Policies based on that information. Included in this repo is a script to simulate the third party API. The overall flow looks like this.
